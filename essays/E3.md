<p>This WOD assignment took me 8 tries just to complete it within the Rx time. At first, I was reading what this is about. What we had to do is create 4 different web pages from the BrowserHistory we are working on. When I first looked at what the results would look like, I thought that this is going to be a fun assignment. I read the steps first to see what I knew how to do and every step seemed new to me. So I have a feeling that it will take me a lot of tries to complete the assignment within the Rx time. I tried doing it first without looking at the screencast first but I’m already lost on the third step. I went ahead to watch the screencast video. After watching the video, I tried doing it again but I’m still having trouble. So, what I did was while watching the video I'm doing the coding at the same time. The part that I had a hard time doing is doing the onmouseover and onclick. It’s either two of the buttons are working and one is not, or all of them working or sometimes it’s not working. Then, when I finally got it and everything was working I continued working. I did it a few more times to see if I could finish it within the Rx time.</p>
