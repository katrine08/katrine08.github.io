I have so many dreams when I was a kid. I remember, when I was in preschool, when people asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up I want to be a doctor so that I can help people who are sick and be able to provide medicine to people who are in need. But growing, my mind keep changing on what I wanted to be. In high school, I tried different things just to see which one interest me. I did film and photography, I enjoyed it but I feel like it is not for me. I also thought of going back to my hometown to pursue pilot but my parents didn't allow me. So, when I graduated high school I went to a community college and majored in Travel Industry Management with the focus on Hospitality Operations Management. 

I thought of majoring in TIM since here in Hawaii there are a lot of opportunity for tourism. I thought, since there are a lot of hotels here, it will not be hard for me to get a job when I finish college. Also, at the same time while studying I was already working in the hotel as a resort photographer and a spa attendant which will make it easy for me to get a job in the hotel. 

However the pandemic happened. From face to face class, we all went to online class. At the same time people are getting laid off from work. I was one of those people. I was saddened of what happened when COVID-19 hit. 

It was also during the pandemic when I graduated from community college. At the same time I started to loosing my interest in my major. I told my mom about it and she was not happy. She asked me what I wanted and I answered her with I don't know.  

Then, I remember I have cousins who are computer science major. I asked them what they do, if it's an okay major, and the difference between an IT and a computer science. I thought of going in to tech since I see that I'm interested on what people do and it seems like its fun. That's why at the end, I deciced to major in Management Information System.
